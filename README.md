# Quirks & Usage Guidelines
- ### Editor View
Switch between editor view (between processed & unprocessed) with the button to the right of "Viewing", below the header in the top right.
To *edit the song*, please use the unprocessed code box. This allows you to run the previously-processed code whilst making a new song.

- ### Processing Changes
To ensure changes are processed, use the *process* or *proc&play* buttons in the top right. You can see if a song and or setting changes are
not yet processed if there is a "modified" badge appearing on the "controls" menu button.
